# DonutzMozaPlugin

This Simhub plugin is meant to control Moza Wheel Base settings based on active game/SIM and the currently selected car.

Installation: just drop all three .dll files (DonutzMozaPlugin.dll, MOZA_API_C.dll and MOZA_API_CSharp.dll) into your Simhub install folder and restart Simhub.

This project is still in alpha phase, so stay tuned for updates in near future.
