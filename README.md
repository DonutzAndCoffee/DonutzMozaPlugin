# DonutzMozaPlugin

This Simhub plugin is meant to control Moza Wheel Base settings based on active game/SIM and the currently selected car.

Installation: just drop all three .dll files (DonutzMozaPlugin.dll, MOZA_API_C.dll and MOZA_API_CSharp.dll) into your Simhub install folder and restart Simhub.

With help of the included Simhub Dashboard you can configure the wheelbase settings even while driving.

This project is still in alpha phase, so stay tuned for updates in near future.
